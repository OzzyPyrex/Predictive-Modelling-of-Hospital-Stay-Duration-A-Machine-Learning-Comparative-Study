# Predictive-Modelling-of-Hospital-Stay-Duration-A-Machine-Learning-Comparative-Study
ABSTRACT
This study explores the field of healthcare analytics with a particular focus on length of stay
(LOS) prediction for hospitalised patients. Using Kaggle's AV Healthcare Analytics II dataset,
which contains a wide range of patient characteristics, we investigate the use of different
machine learning (ML) models for predictive analytics. We want to evaluate the prediction of
patient LOS using Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting,
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), CatBoost, and Neural
Networks.
The dataset provides a wealth of patient data, including demographics, medical history, kind of
admission, and degree of illness, among other things. Through rigorous experimentation and
evaluation, we deploy each ML model to discern patterns and relationships within the data,
aiming to accurately predict the duration of hospital stays. Performance metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to gauge the predictive capabilities of
the models.
We use a comparison approach in our analysis to compare the computational efficiency and
predictive accuracy of several machine learning methods. We assess how well the models
handle the intrinsic complexity of healthcare data and how well they generalise across various
patient groups.
